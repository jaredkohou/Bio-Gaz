Which files and Technologies used?

I used Mongo DB, Express.js ,node, ejs, git, heroku, html ,css js , bootstrap for the css part.


What was the approach was taken?

I created server using express.js first, connected server with mongoDb to store data. To render things dynamically I used ejs.


My unsolved problems?

 Not able to host in heroku app at first. Its running properly in my in local host but there's a bug when deployed.
